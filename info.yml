title: Women Lens

subtitle: A camera of one's own 

description: "Women Lens was born as a project of digital storytelling that wants to investigate which were the most influential women photographers throughout history until today, how they are geographically distributed and in which parallel occupations have been engaged.

Given that women are under-represented in the field of photography, as well as in many other artistic fields, Women Lens is a virtual room entirely dedicated to women photographers and their personal and professional stories. Photography has certainly represented the opening of new horizons, contributing to the emancipation of women. Hence the slogan A camera of oneâ€™s own wants to emphasize the role of the camera as the generator of new visions, entirely female, of the world. Just as Virginia Woolf needed a room of her own to write, women photographers with their personal cameras witness a scenario in constant change that sees them more and more involved and independent.

The research revolves around the role of photography in enhancing women's emancipation.
The investigated sub-topics are: the geographical perspective and in which countries women photographers were more active, how women photographers parallel occupations changed during time and around different countries."
