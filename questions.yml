  title: "Timespan: pioneer, revolutionary and visionary photographers"
  description: "The chronological division of the photographers follows the three volumes of the publication 'Donne Fotografe'. The photographers are organized into three groups depending on the decades: pioneer (1851-1936), revolutionary (1937-1970) and visionary (1970-2010). The pioneering period saw the opening to endless possibilities even if the career of photographer could be a path full of pitfalls for a woman. The revolutionaries will succeed in breaking the traditional patterns through their representations that become a real battleground. Finally, visionaries open up to a new imaginary, placing themselves at the forefront and carving out a space in the constantly evolving field of photography."
