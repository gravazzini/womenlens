      What have been the most widespread parallel occupations in the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom? The four countries with the highest number of female photographers in the entire dataset and the thirteen most widespread and relevant occupations were selected. It is interesting to note the trends and contextualize them to the socio-cultural scenario of the countries. The reading of this path can be combined with the third view that historically frames the parallel occupations.

        <p>Many of the professions are more common in the United States for statistical reasons. It should not be forgotten, in fact, as emerged from the second research topic, that more than double the number of photographers examined in the dataset is of American origin. However, in the United States there are no photographers sculptors, present both in France and in Germany; while the profession of <mark>screenwriter</mark> is present only in the <mark>United States</mark> if we consider these four countries. If we enlarge the view to the entire dataset, another figure of woman screenwriter photographer will emerge unexpectedly: <mark>Shirin Neshat</mark>. <mark>Iranian photographer</mark> living in the United States since 1977, who through his photos and videos investigates the role of women and cultural tensions in his native country. At the beginning of the 2000s, the stories taken from the novel "Women without Men" were adapted for the cinema and awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.</p>

        <p>The profession of <mark>photojournalist</mark> and <mark>journalist</mark> is more widespread in the <mark>United States</mark>, while that of <mark>painter</mark> in <mark>Germany</mark>. If we consider the German cultural scenario, we cannot fail to refer to the <mark>Bauhaus</mark>, a school of art and design in which many German female photographers gravitated by taking courses in painting and industrial desgin initially precluded to women.</p>

        <p><mark>France</mark>, compared to the other selected countries, has a greater number of sculptors, visual artists and <mark>models</mark>. It is no coincidence that France historically is the cradle of the main <mark>fashion houses</mark> in the world and consequently the modeling profession is more widespread there than in other countries.

        <p>The <mark>United Kingdom</mark>, with less data than the other three countries, sees the highest number of photographers engaged as <mark>photoreporters</mark> who are, however, in fewer numbers than the United States. Missing are architectural photographers, sculptors, filmmakers, models, screenwriters, visual artists, teachers and printmakers.</p>
