      <p class="intro-text">
      Originally women photographers were mostly Western and operated in countries where photographic companies, clubs and publications take roots, such as the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. These countries are not only the cradle of the first companies of photographic material, such as Kodak in the United States and Zeiss in Germany but they are the geographical places where women manage to emancipate first and establish themselves in an artistic field such as photography.</p>
      <p>As early as 1913, in an article titled “Photography As a Profession for Women”, Imogen Cunningham had taken a clear stance: “Photography is not a better profession for a woman or for a man, it is simply a profession.” Later, she would elaborate on her point of view: “I am a photographer, not a woman. I don’t think it makes a difference when you work.”

      <div class="main-text-title"><h3>Main findings</h3></div>
      <div class="main-text">
      <p>There are 32 dfferent origin countries where the selected photographers are born. 5 continents represented, with a predominance of the western countries: North America and Europe. In Asia the most represented state is Japan, in South America are Mexico and Argentina, while in Africa we find Algeria, Togo, South Africa and Madagascar.</p>
      <p>Until the 1950s it was still the West, in particular Germany and the United States, to guide the technological development of photography: Zeiss, Kodak, Leica, Contax and Rollei are just some of the authoritative names that we can list in this regard. In 1959, however, the arrival on the market of the <mark>Nikon F</mark> brought with it a series of substantial innovations and was about to become the professional camera par excellence. The role of <mark>Japan</mark> has changed since that moment.</p>

      <p>Thinking about <mark>Mexico</mark>, <mark>Tina Modotti</mark> comes in mind. Tina was an Italian artist who emigrated to the United States and then moved to Mexico together with the photographer and her lover Edward Wetson. Tina Modotti joined the Mexican Communist Party and began to document her country of adoption, with a particular interest in female figures, folklore and religious art.</p>
