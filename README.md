## Abstract
Women Lens is a virtual room entirely dedicated to women photographers and their personal and professional stories. Photography has certainly represented the opening of new horizons, contributing to the emancipation of women. Hence the slogan "A camera of one’s own" wants to emphasize the role of the camera as the generator of new visions, entirely female, of the world. Just as Virginia Woolf needed a room of her own to write, women photographers with their personal cameras witness a scenario in constant change that sees them more involved and independent. Women Lens project has been carried out for the exam of [Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2021/443749) (2021/2022) held by Professor Marilena Daquino, within the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna. 

## Goal
The general objective of the project is to investigate which were the most influential women photographers throughout history until today, how are they geographically distributed and in which parallel occupations have been engaged. The research underlines the role of photography in enhancing women's emancipation. The investigated sub-topics are the timespan perspective and how women photographers were distributed among the decades; the geographical perspective and in which countries women photographers were more active; the professional perspective and how women photographers' parallel occupations changed during the time and around different countries.

## Research topics
1. Timespan: pioneer, revolutionary and visionary photographers
2. Geographical perspective: photographers’ origin countries
3. Photographers’ occupations over the decades
4. Photographers’ occupations over the countries
